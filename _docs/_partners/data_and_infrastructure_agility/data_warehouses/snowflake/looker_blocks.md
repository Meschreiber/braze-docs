# Snowflake Data Share Looker Blocks

[Looker Blocks](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/blocks) can now be installed in Looker instances for those who use both Snowflake and Looker. Looker Blocks are pre-developed data models and views that can be installed through the Looker marketplace. These blocks allow you to quickly leverage and extract insights from your Snowflake Data Sharing partnership. 

A detailed breakdown of the Looker Block can be found in the README file listed in the Braze Github and the project itself. 

## Integration

To install the Snowflake Data Share Looker Blocks, partner with your GSA and data service teams that enable and install the blocks within your own data stack. Once you have established a valid connection and enabled data share, update relevant parameters in your manifest file so that the associated variables are passed to the rest of the code associated variables are passed to the rest of the code associated with the Looker Block.

The code for the blocks is developed within the `snowflake_data_share_looker_block` project within the Braze Looker Partner instance.
